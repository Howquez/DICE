# üì¶ oFeeds

_oFeeds_ provides a collection of [oTree](https://www.otree.org/) apps that mimic **news, shopping- and social media feeds** to enable marketing researchers to create more realistic stimuli for their research.
Importantly, researchers can manipulate a feed in a matter of seconds without writing code: 
just as content management systems, oFeeds is designed such that one only has to change one `.csv` file to change the feed being displayed.
