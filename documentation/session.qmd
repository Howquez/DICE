# Create a Session {#sec-session}

Open the experiment in your browser (either with `http://localhost:8000/` if deployed locally or `https://[your app name].herokuapp.com` if deployed with heroku) and click on _Sessions_ displayed in the header. Subsequently, click on _Create new session_, and then on _Configure session_ (next to the cogwheel). This yields a screen which looks as follows:

![Session Configs Admin Interface](img/screenshot-session-config.png)

This interface allows you to set the number of rows your data base should contain (e.g., 300 in the example above). This number should be larger than the number of participants you need to finish your study simply because participants who enter your experiment (without finishing it) will use up a row in your data base as soon as they enter the experiment.

## Session Configs

Apart from the number of rows in your data base, the interface provides some custom session configurations that may differ between apps. Each session configuration is listed and explained in the table below. In addition, the table assigns these configurations to their corresponding apps (you can configure a `newspaper_name` in `oNovitas` but not in `oTweet`, for instance).

### Common Configs

Because these apps do not apply any incentive compatible payment mechanisms, you can ignore `real_world_currency_per_point` and `participation_fee` for the time being. The `survey_link`, `url_param`, `sort_by` and `data-path` arguments are, in contrast, vital: 

- `survey_link` is used to direct participants to the survey of your choice.
- `url_param` can be used to pass a participant's ID to that survey tool. This is essential to merge the data you collect in oTree with the data you collect in your survey tool.
- `data_path` accepts URLs to your Google drive or a raw github link as well as a directory within the project folder. Importantly, all these paths must refer to a `;`-separated  `*.csv` file that contains the content you want to display in your feed. You'll learn more about the specific requirements in the following chapters.
- I strongly recommend you to make use of the `sort_by` argument. You can pass any column in your data to sort the items of your feed. You can, for instance, create a time stamp or create a random integer (without replacement). This allows you not only to control but also to record the order in which you display. If no value (i.e., column) is provided, the software will shuffle the the feed without recording the order.


### App-specific Configs

The subsequent chapters provide more information on how and why to configure these parameters exactly.


## settings.py (Advanced)

If you prefer to edit these settings in your IDE (such as PyCharm), I recommend you to navigate to the `settings.py` file and edit the `SESSION_CONFIG_DEFAULTS`. These provide default values, which you can easily overwrite.
