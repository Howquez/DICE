abstract = {Recent literature on the intersection of economics, finance and psychology indicates the benefits of simulated experience in tools measuring decision making. Here, we present the Zurich Trading Simulator (ZTS) first used by Andraszewicz et al. (2022) to test the impact of upward social comparison on trading activity. ZTS is a free application for oTree designed to create dynamic investment experiments suitable for measuring trading activity and risk taking. The software is ready-to-use applying the default settings. It can also be freely adapted in the source code depending on the experimenter’s needs. Price paths developed for experiments with the ZTS are freely available online. We also outline recommendations and possibilities for future studies and extensions.}
