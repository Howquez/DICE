# Preface {.unnumbered}

The project `oFeeds` contains three apps `oCom`, `oNovitas` as well as `oTweet` that mimic shopping, news and social media feeds respectively. This document describes how to configure each app to your needs.

All of these apps are based on oTree [@oTree]. Hence, [Chapter -@sec-oTree] first describes how to deploy oTree apps in general. [Chapter -@sec-session] describes how to create and configure a session. Subsequently, [Chapter -@sec-oCom], [Chapter -@sec-oNovitas] and [Chapter -@sec-oTweet] describe the session configurations that apply to the respective apps in detail. The document closes with instructions on how to run an oTree experiment on Prolific.

Please note that both the apps as well as the documentation is under development (in fact, [Chapter -@sec-oCom], [Chapter -@sec-oTweet] and [Chapter -@sec-prolific] are not yet existent). Hence, feedback are much appreciated. If you have any comments, questions or requests, don't hesitate to reach out to me via [email](mailto:hauke.roggenkamp@unisg.ch) or create an [issue](https://github.com/Howquez/oFeeds/issues) in the corresponding github repository.
