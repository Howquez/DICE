# Preface

The project `oFeeds` contains three apps 

1. `oCom`, 
2. `oNovitas` and 
3. `oTweet` 

that mimic shopping, news as well as social media feeds, respectively. This document describes how to configure each app to your needs.

All of these apps are based on oTree [@oTree]. Hence, all of these apps share some common ground that will be described in the first few chapters: [Chapter -@sec-oTree] first describes how to deploy oTree apps in general. [Chapter -@sec-session] describes how to create and configure a session. Subsequently, [Chapter -@sec-oCom], [Chapter -@sec-oNovitas] and [Chapter -@sec-oTweet] describe the session configurations that apply to the respective apps in detail. The document closes with instructions on how to run an oTree experiment on Prolific.

## Features

Please note that both the apps as well as the documentation are under development (in fact, [Chapter -@sec-oCom], [Chapter -@sec-oTweet] and [Chapter -@sec-prolific] don't even exist). Hence, feedback is much appreciated. If you have any comments, questions or requests, don't hesitate to reach out to me via [email](mailto:hauke.roggenkamp@unisg.ch) or create an [issue](https://github.com/Howquez/oFeeds/issues) in the corresponding github repository.
