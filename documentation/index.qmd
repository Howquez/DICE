# Preface {.unnumbered}

The project `oFeeds` contains three apps 

1. `oCom`, 
2. `oNovitas` and 
3. `oTweet` 

that mimic shopping, news as well as social media feeds, respectively. This document describes how to configure each app to your needs.

All of these apps are based on oTree [@oTree]. Hence, all of these apps share some common ground. [Chapter -@sec-oTree] first describes how to deploy oTree apps in general. [Chapter -@sec-session] describes how to create and configure a session. Subsequently, [Chapter -@sec-oCom], [Chapter -@sec-oNovitas] and [Chapter -@sec-oTweet] describe the session configurations that apply to the respective apps in detail. The document closes with instructions on how to run an oTree experiment on Prolific.

Please note that both the apps as well as the documentation is under development (in fact, [Chapter -@sec-oCom], [Chapter -@sec-oTweet] and [Chapter -@sec-prolific] don't even exist). Hence, feedback is much appreciated. If you have any comments, questions or requests, don't hesitate to reach out to me via [email](mailto:hauke.roggenkamp@unisg.ch) or create an [issue](https://github.com/Howquez/oFeeds/issues) in the corresponding github repository.
