    "text": "oFeeds Logo\n\n\n\n1 Preface\nThe project oFeeds contains three apps\n\noCom,\noNovitas and\noTweet\n\nthat mimic shopping, news as well as social media feeds, respectively. This document describes how to configure each app to your needs.\n\n\n\noFeeds Screenshots\n\n\nAll of these apps are based on oTree (Chen, Schonger, and Wickens 2016). Hence, all of these apps share some common ground that will be described in the first few chapters: Chapter 1 first describes how to deploy oTree apps in general. Chapter 2 describes how to create and configure a session. Subsequently, Chapter 3, Chapter 4 and Chapter 5 describe the session configurations that apply to the respective apps in detail. The document closes with instructions on how to run an oTree experiment on Prolific.\nPlease note that both the apps as well as the documentation are under development (in fact, Chapter 3, Chapter 5 and Chapter 6 don’t even exist). Hence, feedback is much appreciated. If you have any comments, questions or requests, don’t hesitate to reach out to me via email or create an issue in the corresponding github repository.\noFeeds is licensed under the MIT open source license with the added requirement of a citation of Roggenkamp (2023). This licensing approach provides users with the liberty to utilize, adapt, and share the software with minimal constraints to foster collaborative development in line with open-source and open science principles.\n\n\n\nBibTeX\n\n@misc{Roggenkamp_2023,\n  title={oFeeds},\n  url={osf.io/jcxvk},\n  publisher={OSF},\n  author={Roggenkamp, Hauke C},\n  year={2023},\n  month={Sep}\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChen, Daniel L., Martin Schonger, and Chris Wickens. 2016. “oTree—an Open-Source Platform for Laboratory, Online, and Field Experiments.” Journal of Behavioral and Experimental Finance 9: 88–97. https://doi.org/doi.org/10.1016/j.jbef.2015.12.001.\n\n\nRoggenkamp, Hauke C. 2023. “oFeeds.” OSF. osf.io/jcxvk."

    "section": "1.3 Deploy oFeeds on a Server",
    "text": "1.3 Deploy oFeeds on a Server\nTo increase the ease of deployment, oTree’s basic server setup is tied to Heroku. oTree’s official documentation explains that:\n\nHeroku is a commercial cloud hosting provider. It is the simplest way to deploy oTree. The Heroku free plan is sufficient for testing your app, but once you are ready to launch a study, you should upgrade to a paid server, which can handle more traffic. However, Heroku is quite inexpensive, because you only pay for the time you actually use it. If you run a study for only 1 day, you can turn off your dynos and addons, and then you only pay 1/30 of the monthly cost. Often this means you can run a study for just a few dollars.\n\nThis implies that you need to set up a Heroku account. In addition, you’ll need an oTree Hub account. oTree Hub automates your server setup and ensures your server is correctly configured. It also offers error/performance monitoring. Just start with the cheapest account and see how far it gets you.\nThe following steps will guide you through the process. You can (and probably should) also watch this video to get you started.\n\nVisit Heroku and create an account\nVisit oTree Hub and create an account.\nOn oTree Hub, click on Heroku server deployment.\nClick on Connect to Heroku.\nThis will navigate you to a Heroku login interface. Log in to proceed.\nThis will redirect you to oTree Hub and ask you to verify your Heroku account by providing credit card details. Do that (on Heroku) to proceed.\nNext, visit your Heroku Dashboard and create a new app. Tipp: Use a rather generic name that you can reuse for future (and potentially unrelated) studies.\nGo back to oTree Hub, click Heroku in the navigation bar. You should see the Heroku app you just created beneath Other Sites. Click on register right next to it.\nYour Heroku app should now be displayed as an Active Site. Click on Deploy.\nThis will direct you to an interface where you can upload your *.otreezip file. Click on Browse to do so. If you haven’t done so already, you can download the *.otreezip file of the application you are interested in (that is, oCom, oNovitas, oTweet) from GitHub or OSF.\nClick Upload and wait for up to a few minutes.\nClick Configure to set up your data base.\nFor testing purposes, choose\n\nthe smallest Postgres plan (mini), as well as\nthe smallest Dyno size (Eco),\nopen access OTREE_AUTH_LEVEL, and\nOTREE_PRODUCTION off (to display error messages etc.).\n\nSubmit changes. You can verify, change and undo these settings on Heroku: visit your app and click on Resources. This will also show you the estimates monthly costs of deployment.\nTo run a study, choose different settings on oTree Hub, i.e., a larger Postgres plan, larger Dyno size and OTREE_PRODUCTION on.\nOn oTree Hub, click Reset database. Be aware that this will delete all the data you may have collected in a previous study.\nClick on the link provided in the upper third of the page, that is, https://[your app name].herokuapp.com. This will yield the same interface as if you tested the study locally on a devserver (described in Section 1.2 of this chapter).\nDone. You can now create and configure sessions to distribute the study to participants. See Chapter 2 for more information.\n\nThe following chapters will describe how to do that for each app individually. (The apps differ slightly with respect to their features, for instance, because the news feed can display two banner ads, while the other can only display one. For that reason, the apps’ configurations differ too.)\n\nSee how to configure a oCom session in Chapter 3.\nSee how to configure a oNovitas session in Chapter 4.\nSee how to configure a oTweet session in Chapter 5."

Open your command line tool and navigate (cd) to your desired directory. Within that directory, unpack the otreezip file you just downloaded (e.g., oTweet.otreezip) using the following command:\n\notree unzip oTweet.otreezip\n\nThis upacks the python project which contains predominantly Python code but also some JavaScript, HTML and CSS. You can edit it in your favorite IDE (such as PyCharm). I advice you to consult the oTree documentation if you want to edit the app’s backend as well as the Bootstrap 5.2 documentation if you want to edit the frontend. In addition, the subsequent chapters describe oFeeds’ apps in more detail.\nAfter editing your code, use your command line tool, navigate to the project directory (where a settings.py file is located) and run the following command to re-pack the project into the *.otreezip file again:\n\notree zip\n\nYou will need this otreezip file to deploy the project on a server."

I recommend to use the same directory or even overwrite that specific file for convenience.\nYou can upload the csv file to your Google drive and provide the corresponding URL.\nYou can upload the csv file to your github repository and provide the raw URL (navigate to your csv file, click on raw and copy the resulting URL. It should start with https://raw.githubusercontent.com/).\n\nYour file must comprise the following columns:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ndoc_id\nUnique numeric identifier needed to loop through the csv file. Can also be used for pseudo-random sorting of content.\n\n\ncondition\nIf you wish to manipulate the feed between-subjects, use this column with as many values as required.\n\n\ntag\nTag that allows you to cluster your content (e.g., technology, diet, economy).\n\n\ntitle\nHeadline of new item.\n\n\nteaser\nShort text that describes the news item.\n\n\ncontent\nFull text in HTML format that only becomes visible once a participant clicks on the corresponding news item.\n\n\nauthor\nThe news item’s author.\n\n\npublishedAt\nThe day of publication.\n\n\nurlToImage\nURL to an image that shall be displayed. We recommend landscape-like ratios and sources such as unsplash.com.\n\n\nsponsored\nDummy that indicates whether the content shall represent actual news items or native advertising.\n\n\nurl\nIf a news item is sponsored, you do not need any content but a URL of some landing page where the participant is directed to (in a new browser tab).\n\n\n...\nAdd as many columns as you like. You could add a column that determines how the feed is sorted, for instance.\n\n\n\nYou find an exemplary data set scraped from the News API in your project folder (after you unzipped it)1 oNovitas/news/static/data/news.csv or here on github.\nTechnically, all the requirements and mechanisms mentioned above are defined in creating_subsession() and read_feed() in oNovitas/news/__init__.py.\n\n4.1.1 Sticky Header\nYou can control the name displayed in the sticky header in the session configurations. Currently, newspaper_name defaults to ‘The Daily News’.\n\n\n4.1.2 News Items\nAs outlined above, the news items are defined in a csv file. The feed just loops through each row and checks whether sponsored is True or False.\nIf sponsored == False, the content is displayed as a regular news item. Clicking on it opens a modal (or ‘pop-up window’) that displays the full content, that is, the full text alongside some meta data such as the author, etc.\n\n\n4.1.3 Sponsored Content\nIf sponsored == True, the content is displayed slightly differently. For instance, the item’s background color is rather beige than white. In addition, there is a sponsored tag indicating the native advertisement. Importantly, a click on the item directs the participant towards a landing page. It does not open the modal a participant is exposed to when clicking on a news item.\n\n\n4.1.4 Finish-Button\nAt the bottom of the page is a button. Clicking on it, a participant submits the page and cannot go back. The participant will then see a page directing her to your survey. Section 2.1.1 describes how to configure the redirect while maintaining the participant’s id and the completion code required to inform the recruitment tool (e.g., Prolific) that the specific participant finished the study."
