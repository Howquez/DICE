0;11.06.24 09:19;"4 and 5 year olds arriving at school in nappies would not have happened 5 to 10 years ago.... Why?
Because basic #Parenting has bizarrely vanished.
Toilet training, eating at a table, cleaning teeth, making a bed, tying shoe laces, crossing a road, reading, writing.... These things are boring and can be torture to teach to toddlers who scream if you take away the ipad.
And for parents it's much easier to sit scrolling, addicted to screens, unaware that hours have passed.
