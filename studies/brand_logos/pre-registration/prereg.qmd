In this study, we replicate the `unfamiliar` treatment arm in @LuffarelliMukeshMahmood_2019 [Study 4]. The authors hypothesize that 

- more (vs. less) descriptive logos elicit stronger impressions of brand authenticity, and that
- more descriptive logos positively influence brand evaluations and purchase intentions.

To test these hypotheses, the authors created logos that vary in the degree to which they describe the brand.

We adopt the original stimuli to our DICE setting and collect new data in an US Prolific sample to test the authors' hypotheses using the same self-report measures. 

# Stimuli

We adopt the authors' stimuli describing a London-based tea brand called _Nemi_ tha actually exists and which is, according to the authors, relatively unknown.

We use the original study's brand description^[ _"London-based tea company offering a variety of whole leaf tea blends as loose tea and in biodegradable tea pyramids along with a Chai Syrup for chai lattes, iced teas and chai cocktails."_] and the logos to which we add a generic copy (that is, _"Discover the Essence of Nature"_) before embedding the resulting stimuli (see @fig-stimuli) as sponsored ads in a social media feed ([link](https://web.archive.org/web/20240506144426/https://ibt-hsg.herokuapp.com/p/2549f1dl/DICE/C_Feed/3)).

Stimuli
:::

The ad itself contains the image as well as a tweet that is inspired by the author's brand description and which is held constant across conditions:

> _Transform your daily rituals with our finest tea selections. Explore our whole leaf blends, available as loose tea or in biodegradable pyramids, and our versatile Chai Syrup for lattes, iced teas, and chai cocktails._

The feed is an interactive DICE feed that resembles twitter and covers posts from various users who share insights on topics such as yoga, meditation, healthy eating, and sustainable living practices. It contains 36 posts where the focal brand's sponsored ad is displayed in fifth position.


# Method and Measures

We run a 2-cell (descriptive vs. generic logo) between-subjects design in which each participant faces the same social media feed. The only difference between both conditions is that the focal brand's logo is either descriptive of generic.

After participants browse the social media feed, they are redirected to a qualtrics survey that starts with basic demographic questions. Subsequently, participants indicate whether they engage in wellness activities and follow a healthy lifestyle. Afterwards, they answer unaided and aided recall questions to indicate whether they remember seeing a _Nemi_ or tea-related ad. 

Finally, we expose participants to the same measures @LuffarelliMukeshMahmood_2019 used, that is, 9-point Likert items describing the brand evaluation, purchase intention, as well as the perceived brand authenticity (in that order).


# Primary Analysis

Our primary interest lies in the effect of the logo descriptiveness on brand evaluations. Because the authors found a strong effect where more descriptive logos are associated with more positive brand descriptions, we also expect a positive effect and can compare means using a simple OLS and a one sided test.

# Secondary Analysis

We expect heterogeneous treatment effects, where recall and the (absence of) the dwell time participants allocate to the focal brand's sponsored ad moderate the treatment: Those participants who have not seen or processed the ad (approximated by a lack of dwell time and failures to recall the ad, respectively), shouldn't be affected by the brand logo.

# Population

We will recruit participants from Prolific who meet the following criteria:

- Approval Rate >= 99%
- First Language == ‘English’
- Location == ‘USA’

Doing so, we deviate from the original study which was conducted with students from two universities in England. We assume the US participants to be less familiar with the London-based focal brand.

# Sample Size 

As stated above, we expect our treatment effect to be heterogeneous and, thus, overall smaller (compared to the published result) because our stimuli contain more context. As a consequence, the sponsored ad can only affect brand evaluations if it cuts through the content clutter [@Ordenes_2019].

Hence, we recruit 400 participants (about four times as many as in the original study). To this end, we create a database containing 500 rows.

# Exclusion Criteria

We will only consider complete observations, that is, data from participants who browsed through the feed, answered the qualtrics survey and who were redirected to Prolific with a functional completion code.

Because we gather process data, such as dwell time, we have tools to assess the data quality [@CuskleySulik_2024] -- at least during the exposure to the social media feed. If these data reveal inattentive participants, for instance, we may exclude them too but label the resulting analyses as exploratory.

# Prior Data Collection

We did not collect any data to replicate any study by @LuffarelliMukeshMahmood_2019 before.
