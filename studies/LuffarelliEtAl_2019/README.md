This study replicates the unfamiliar treatment arm of study 4 in Luffarelli et al. (2019, p. 870) using stimuli for the 
same London-based tea brand called _Nemi_ (that actually exists but which is relatively unknown according to the authors).
Whereas the authors recruited students from two universities in England, we recruit US participants who should be less familiar with the brand 

- Brand evaluations as in Study 2: evaluated the target brand on two nine-point scales presented in a random order (1 = “do not like at all/very unfavorable”, and 9 = “like a lot/very favorable”)
- Purchase intentions as in Study 3: (1 = “very unlikely/not probable at all”, and 9 = “very likely/very probable;”)
- Authenticity in Study 1: impressions that the brand was authentic on three nine-point scales presented in a random order (authentic, trustworthy, and credible; 1 = “not at all”, and 9 = “very”; adapted from Morhart et al. 2015; Napoli et al. 2014).
- Brand familiarity: How familiar were you with the brand Nemi (1 = "not at all", and 9 = "very")
